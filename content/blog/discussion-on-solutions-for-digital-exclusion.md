## What are the solutions for digital exclusion?

I believe the role of digital assistants is crucial. The digitally excluded population, who are entirely unfamiliar with digital devices, often lack even the most basic knowledge of how to use them. Many struggle not only with searching on smartphones but also with simple tasks like touch, scroll, and keyboard usage. Given that they may quickly forget these skills, having a digital assistant provide direct assistance seems to be the most effective approach. For those who are somewhat more familiar with digital devices but underutilize them, providing education on search methods and the usage of technologies like artificial intelligence chatbots could offer opportunities for self-learning.

If you are a Korean Linux user, you might have experienced some difficulties in Korean input.
This post is for those who are new to Linux and want to use Korean input.

# IME(Input Method Engine)

To use Korean input, you need to use IME.
There are several IMEs for Korean input, but I my recommendations are:

1. `ibus-hangul` for GNOME
2. `fcitx-hangul` for KDE
3. [`kime`](https://github.com/Riey/kime) for standalone window managers
